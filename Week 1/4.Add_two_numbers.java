/* Here, we used variables to store values of two integers and their sum. Thus, a
variable is a basic unit of storage in a Java program.
Syntax for Declaring a Variable:   type variable_name [ = value];


Here, type is one of Javaâ€™s primitive datatypes. The variable_name is the name of
a variable. We can initialize the variable by specifying an equal sign and a value
(Initialization is optional). 

However, the compiler never assigns a default value to
an uninitialized local variable in Java.


While writing variable names you should be careful and follow the rules for
naming them. 

Following are the rules for writing variable names 


1. All variable names may contain uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z, A-Z),
underscore ( _ ), dollar sign ($) and the digits 0 to 9. The dollar sign character
is not intended for general use. No spaces and no other special characters
are allowed.
2. The variable names must not begin with a number.
3. Java is case-sensitive. Uppercase characters are distinct from lowercase
characters.
4. A Java keyword (reserved word) cannot be used as a variable name.
