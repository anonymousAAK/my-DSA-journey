//After creating a class .
// Here's the first code
package fundamentals;
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

/* Consider the following line of code:
public static void main(String[] args)
1. This is the line at which the program will begin executing. This statement
is similar to start block in flowcharts. All Java programs begin execution
by calling main()
2. We will understand what public, static, void mean in subsequent
lectures. For now we should assume that we have to write main as it is.
3. The curly braces {} indicate start and end of mai                       */
