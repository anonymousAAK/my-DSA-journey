/* In order to print things to console we have to write - 
System.out.println("HelloWorld").
Again for now we should leave System.out.print mean, and should write it as it is The built-in method print() is used to display the string which is passed to it. This
output string is not followed by a newline, i.e., the next output will start on thesame line. 

The built-in method println() is similar to print(), except that println()  outputs a newline after each call. */
